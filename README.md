## Comparison between Landsat-based surface water products and Sentinel-2 based surface water occurance
This is the companion code to 'Long-term lake area trends: how small, shallow lakes with emergent vegetation muddy the water'


### Data analysis, visualization, and summary 
_MakeLakeTable.py_ takes input shapefiles of lakes and input csv of fractal dimensions and outputs a summary table (Table 1)  

_LandsatAnalysis_MLmodel.ipynb_ Fits the machine learning model relating the mean relative difference between products in dry years subtracted from the mean relative difference between products in wet years to various explantory features.
